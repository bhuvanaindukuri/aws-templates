### Advantages of cloud computing

- Trade capital expense for variable expense
- Benefit from massive economies of scale
- Stop guessing capacity
- Incresed speed and agility
- Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centres
- Go global in minutes

### Infrastructure

<b>Region:</b>
 physical location around the world where the data centers are clustered
 
<b>Availability zone:</b>\
An Availability Zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region

<b>Edge location:</b>\
A site that CloudFront uses to cache copies of your content for faster delivery to users at any location.

<b>Local Zone:</b>\
AWS Local Zones place compute, storage, database, and other select AWS services closer to end-users

<b>AWS Wavelength:</b>\
AWS Wavelength embeds AWS compute and storage services within 5G networks, providing mobile edge computing infrastructure for developing, deploying, and scaling ultra-low-latency applications.

<b>AWS Outposts:</b>\
AWS Outposts is a family of fully managed solutions delivering AWS infrastructure and services to virtually any on-premises or edge location for a truly consistent hybrid experience

<b>AWS GovCloud (US)</b>
AWS GovCloud (US) consist of isolated AWS Regions designed to allow U.S. government agencies and customers move sensitive workloads into the cloud by addressing their specific regulatory and compliance requirements

1. Operational Excellence
   - Design Principles
     - Perform operations as code - Infra as code
     - Annotate documentation
     - make frequent , small , reversible changes
     - Refine operations procedure frequently
2. Security
   - Design Principles
     - Implement strong identity foundation
     - Enable traceability
     - Apply security at all layers
     - Automate security best practices
     - Protect data in transit and at rest
     - keep people away from data
     - prepare for security events
3. Reliability
   - Design Principles
     - Test recovery procedures
     - Automatically recover from failure
     - scale horizontally
     - Stop guessing capacity
     - Manage change in automation
4. Performance Efficiency
   - Design Principles
