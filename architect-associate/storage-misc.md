### AWS Storage Gateway
- Bridge between on-premises data and cloud data 
- Use cases:
  - disaster recovery
  - backup & restore
  - tiered storage
  - on-premises cache & low-latency files access
- Types of Storage Gateway:
  - S3 File Gateway
    - Configured S3 bucket accessible as NFS using NFS and SMB protocol
    - Most recently used data is cached in the file gateway
    - Bucket access using IAM roles for each File Gateway
    - SMB Protocol has integration with Active Directory (AD) for user authentication  
  - FSx File Gateway
    - Native access to Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
    - Local cache for frequently accessed data
    - Windows native compatibility (SMB, NTFS, Active Directory...) 
    - Useful for group file shares and home directories
  - Volume Gateway
    - Block storage using iSCSI protocol backed by S3
    - Backed by EBS snapshots which can help restore on-premises volumes!
    - Cached volumes: low latency access to most recent data
    - Stored volumes: entire dataset is on premise, scheduled backups to S3
  - Tape Gateway
    - Some companies have backup processes using physical tapes (!)
    - With Tape Gateway, companies use the same processes but, in the cloud
    - Virtual Tape Library (VTL) backed by Amazon S3 and Glacier
    - Back up data using existing tape-based processes (and iSCSI interface)
    - Works with leading backup software vendors 

### AWS Transfer Family
- A fully-managed service for file transfers into and out of Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS using the FTP protocol
- Supported Protocols
  - AWS Transfer for FTP (File Transfer Protocol (FTP))
  - AWS Transfer for FTPS (File Transfer Protocol over SSL (FTPS))
  - AWS Transfer for SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP))
- Managed infrastructure, Scalable, Reliable, Highly Available (multi-AZ)
- Pay per provisioned endpoint per hour + data transfers in GB
- Store and manage users’ credentials within the service
- Integrate with existing authentication systems (Microsoft Active Directory, LDAP, Okta, Amazon Cognito, custom)
- Usage: sharing files, public datasets, CRM, ERP, 


### AWS DataSync
 - Move large amount of data to and from
    - On-premises / other cloud to AWS (NFS, SMB, HDFS, S3 API…) – needs agent
    - AWS to AWS (different storage services) – no agent needed
 - Can synchronize to:
    - Amazon S3 (any storage classes – including Glacier)
    - Amazon EFS
    - Amazon FSx (Windows, Lustre, NetApp, OpenZFS...) 
 - Replication tasks can be scheduled hourly, daily, weekly
 - <b> File permissions and metadata are preserved </b> (NFS POSIX, SMB…) 
 - One agent task can use 10 Gbps, can setup a bandwidth limit

##### Common storage protocols
- Server Message Block (SMB)
- Network File System (NFS)
