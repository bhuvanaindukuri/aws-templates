### AWS FSx
- Launch high-performance file systems on AWS
- Fully Managed Service
- Options currently available
  - FSx for Lustre
    - Lustre is a type of parallel distributed file system, for large-scale computing
    - The name Lustre is derived from “Linux” and “cluster
    - Machine Learning, <b> High Performance Computing (HPC) </b>
    - Video Processing, Financial Modeling, Electronic Design Automation
    - Scales up to 100s GB/s, millions of IOPS, sub-ms latencies
    - Storage Options:
      - SSD – low-latency, IOPS intensive workloads, small & random file operations
      - HDD – throughput-intensive workloads, large & sequential file operations
    - Seamless integration with S3
      - Can “read S3” as a file system (through FSx)
      - Can write the output of the computations back to S3 (through FSx)
    - Can be used from on-premises servers (VPN or Direct Connect)
    - 2 Deployment options
      - Scratch File System
        - Temporary storage
        - Data not persisted
      - Persistent File System
