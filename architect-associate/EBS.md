### Elastic Block Storage(EBS)
 - Itâ€™s a network drive (i.e. not a physical drive)
   - Uses the network to communicate the instance, which means there might be a bit of latency
   - It can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly
- Locked to an Availability Zone (AZ)
- To move a volume across, you first need to snapshot it
- Have a provisioned capacity (size in GBs, and IOPS)
- Billed for all the provisioned capacity
- You can increase the capacity of the drive over time
- Can be assigned to only one instance at a time which means it cant be used for sharing data
