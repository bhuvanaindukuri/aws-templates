#### Notes

- EC2 User Data - Scripts to be executed when the machine starts
- Naming convention - <instance type><generation>.<resource size> Ex: t2.micro

#### Types fo EC2 instances - Based on resources

Each type has different classes
- General purpose instances
  - Balance between compute, memory and networking
  - Starts with t, m and A
- Compute optimized
  - Good for batch processing, Media transcoding, ML etc
  - Start with C
- Memory optimized
  - Good for high performance databases
  - STarts with R(Stands for RAM),X
- Accelerated computing
- Storage optimized instances
  -  storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage
- Instance features
- Measuring instance performance
