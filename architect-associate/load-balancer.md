### Intro
- DNS mapping/common URL
- Health checks
- Elastic

#### Hands-on
- Application Load Balancer with EC2 Target group
  - https://app.pluralsight.com/labs/detail/2179e97e-190a-45a2-b6ed-8d87a101de9f

#### Types of Load balancers in AWS
- Classic Load Balancers
  - Support HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, SSL
  - v1 old generation
  - Deprecated
- Application Load balancers
  - Support HTTP, HTTPS, Websocket
  - Layer 7 only
  - v2 new generation
  - Accessed through security groups
  - Routing is possible
    - By Path
    - By hostname
    - By query string or parameters
    - By request headers
  - IP of the client is passed as headers X-Forwarded-For, X-Forwarded-Port and X-Forwarded-Proto 
  - Target group can be EC2, ECS, Lambda etc
- Network Load Balancer
  - TCP, TLS, UDP
  - v2 new generation
  - Layer 4
  - More performant than ALB
  - 1 static IP per AZ or can assign Elastic IP
  - Target groups can be EC2, Private IP, ALB, Lambda etc
  - Health check supports TCP, HTTP or HTTPS
- Gateway load balancer
  - Layer 3/ Network layer
  - IP Protocol
  - Useful for inspecting all traffic Ex: Firewall, Intrusion detection & Prevention systems etc
  - Combines Transparent network gateway & Load balancer
  - Target group can be EC2, private IPs

#### ELB Sticky Session
- Based on Cookies
- Can be used for CLB and ALB
- Can be updated at target group level
- Names
  - Application-based cookies
    - Custom cookie
       - Generated by Application 
    - Application cookie
      - Generated by AWS 
  - Duration based cookie
#### Cross-zone load balancing
- Load distributed equally across all instances across AZs
- Without it is equally distributed across members of target group
- Can be updated under attributes in LB
- Enabled by default for ALB but can be disabled at target group level
- Disabled by default for other load balancer types
- For NLB & GLB, charged for inter AZ data tranfer if enabled

#### Certificates
- ALB & NLB support multiple listeners with multiple certificates
- Both use Server Name Indication(SNI) to make it work

#### Connection draining
- Also called Deregistration delay
- Time to complete "in-flight requests" while the instance is de-registering or unhealthy

### Auto Scaling Group(ASG)
- Set Minimum, Desired & Maximum capacity
- Health check of LB can be passed to ASG
- Possible to scale based on CloudWatch alarms
- Scaling cooldown - 5mins after a scaling event when no scaling actions are done

#### ASG 
- Dynamic Scaling
  - Target tracking scaling Ex: Average ASG CPU to stay around 40%
  - Simple/Step Scaling 
    - Based on CloudWatch Alarms Ex: Add 2 when alarm triggered
  - Scheduled Actions
- Predictive Scaling
